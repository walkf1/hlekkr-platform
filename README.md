# 🛡️ Hlekkr - Next-Generation Media Integrity Platform

**🏆 Award-Winning Innovation in AI-Powered Deepfake Detection & Human-AI Collaboration**

Hlekkr revolutionizes media verification through cutting-edge AI analysis, intelligent human-in-the-loop workflows, and immutable audit trails. Our platform combines Amazon Bedrock's advanced foundation models with innovative human expertise integration to deliver unparalleled media authenticity verification.

## About This Repository (Kiro Hackathon Submission)

This repository contains the source code for the "Hlekkr" platform, submitted for the 2025 Code with Kiro Hackathon.

The project's narrative involved the complete, spec-driven transformation of a legacy project called 'G.R.A.C.E.' into the modern Hlekkr platform, using Kiro as an AI development partner. This repository represents the final, A-grade MVP that was produced through this agentic workflow.

The original, pre-transformation 'G.R.A.C.E.' repository can be viewed for historical context here: `https://github.com/walkf1/GRACE`
