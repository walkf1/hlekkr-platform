# Contributing to Hlekkr

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hlekkr! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Vision

Hlekkr is dedicated to combating misinformation through advanced deepfake detection and media verification. We welcome contributions that advance this mission while maintaining high standards of code quality, security, and user experience.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

Please Note: Kiro Hackathon Judging Period

This project is currently under review for the 2025 Code with Kiro Hackathon.

To ensure the integrity of our submission and to provide a stable codebase for the judges, we will be temporarily pausing the merge of any external pull requests until the judging period is complete (late September 2025).

We still encourage you to open issues, report bugs, and suggest features. We will actively review them and will resume merging community contributions after the hackathon. Thank you for your understanding.
### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all infrastructure code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate trust score for media content
 * @param mediaId - Unique identifier for the media
 * @param analysisData - Analysis results from various detectors
 * @returns Promise resolving to trust score object
 */
async function calculateTrustScore(
  mediaId: string, 
  analysisData: AnalysisData
): Promise<TrustScore> {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names

```python
def analyze_deepfake(media_id: str, media_info: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze media for deepfake indicators.
    
    Args:
        media_id: Unique identifier for the media
        media_info: Metadata and location information
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing analysis results and confidence scores
    """
    # Implementation
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- All new functions must have unit tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios

```python
def test_calculate_trust_score_high_confidence():
    """Test trust score calculation with high confidence data."""
    # Test implementation
```

#### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Verify AWS service integrations
- Test error handling and recovery

### Security Guidelines

#### Data Protection
- Never log sensitive information
- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow principle of least privilege

#### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement rate limiting

```python
def validate_media_id(media_id: str) -> bool:
    """Validate media ID format and safety."""
    if not media_id or len(media_id) > 100:
        return False
    
    # Check for valid characters only
    import re
    return bool(re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$', media_id))
```

### Performance Guidelines

#### Lambda Functions
- Keep functions focused and lightweight
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Monitor memory usage and execution time

#### Infrastructure
- Use appropriate instance sizes
- Implement auto-scaling where needed
- Optimize database queries
- Use caching strategically
