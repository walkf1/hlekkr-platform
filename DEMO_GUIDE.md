# 🎯 Hlekkr Platform Demo Guide for Judges

## 🚀 Live Deployment Status

**✅ PRODUCTION DEPLOYED**
- **API URL**: [Deployed to AWS API Gateway]
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 (after `npm start` in frontend/)
- **AWS Region**: eu-central-1
- **GitHub Integration**: Active with hlekkr-framework repository

## 🧪 Testing the Complete HITL Workflow

### 1. Test Upload System
```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3001
# Upload any image/video file
# System generates presigned URLs and stores in S3
```

### 2. Test HITL Workflow
```bash
# Run comprehensive HITL test
node test-hitl-workflow.js

# Expected output:
# ✅ Media Analysis - Low trust score triggers review
# ✅ Human Review - Moderator confirms deepfake  
# ✅ Threat Intelligence - Report generated
# ✅ GitHub Integration - Ready for publishing
```

### 3. Test GitHub Integration
```bash
# Activate GitHub publishing
node activate-github-integration.js

# Verify configuration
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/hlekkr/prod/github/token" --with-decryption
```
