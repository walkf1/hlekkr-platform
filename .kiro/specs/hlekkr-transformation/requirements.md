# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming GRACE (General Research Audit and Computational Evidence) into Hlekkr - a high-trust audit platform specifically designed to identify and grade deepfakes, increasing user trust in media sources. The transformation maintains GRACE's proven immutable audit trail architecture while pivoting from general computational science auditing to specialized media verification and deepfake detection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Platform Rebranding and Identity

**User Story:** As a platform stakeholder, I want the system to be completely rebranded from GRACE to Hlekkr, so that it reflects the new focus on media verification and deepfake detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN all AWS resources SHALL use "hlekkr" prefixes instead of "grace"
2. WHEN users access the platform THEN all UI elements SHALL display "Hlekkr" branding
3. WHEN documentation is viewed THEN all references SHALL be updated from GRACE to Hlekkr
4. WHEN APIs are called THEN endpoints SHALL use "/media/" paths instead of "/audits/"
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL reference Hlekkr components and terminology

### Requirement 2: Media Processing and Upload

**User Story:** As a content creator or journalist, I want to upload various media files (images, videos, audio) to the platform, so that they can be analyzed for authenticity and deepfake detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads media THEN the system SHALL accept common formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, JPG, PNG, MP3, WAV)
2. WHEN media is uploaded THEN metadata SHALL be automatically extracted and stored
3. WHEN large files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL support multipart uploads up to 5GB
4. WHEN media is stored THEN it SHALL be organized by type, date, and user in S3
5. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL trigger automated analysis workflows

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Deepfake Detection

**User Story:** As a media analyst, I want the system to automatically detect potential deepfakes in uploaded media, so that I can quickly identify manipulated content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media is analyzed THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock for deepfake detection
2. WHEN analysis completes THEN a confidence score (0-100%) SHALL be generated
3. WHEN deepfakes are detected THEN specific manipulation techniques SHALL be identified
4. WHEN analysis fails THEN appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms SHALL activate
5. WHEN results are ready THEN they SHALL be stored in the immutable audit trail

### Requirement 4: Trust Score Calculation

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want to see a comprehensive trust score for media content, so that I can make informed decisions about source reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media analysis completes THEN a composite trust score SHALL be calculated
2. WHEN calculating trust scores THEN multiple factors SHALL be considered (deepfake probability, source history, metadata consistency)
3. WHEN trust scores are displayed THEN they SHALL be color-coded (green: high trust, yellow: medium, red: low)
4. WHEN scores change THEN the audit trail SHALL record all modifications with timestamps
5. WHEN users query scores THEN historical trends SHALL be available

### Requirement 5: Source Verification and Provenance

**User Story:** As a fact-checker, I want to verify the original source and chain of custody for media content, so that I can establish authenticity and detect potential manipulation points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media is uploaded THEN original source information SHALL be captured and verified
2. WHEN media has been processed THEN each step SHALL be recorded in the immutable ledger
3. WHEN provenance is queried THEN a complete chain of custody SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN sources are verified THEN external validation services SHALL be integrated
5. WHEN discrepancies are found THEN alerts SHALL be generated for manual review

### Requirement 6: Real-time Monitoring and Alerts

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to monitor deepfake detection activities in real-time, so that I can respond quickly to emerging threats or system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suspicious content is detected THEN real-time alerts SHALL be sent to administrators
2. WHEN system performance degrades THEN monitoring dashboards SHALL display warnings
3. WHEN analysis queues grow THEN auto-scaling mechanisms SHALL activate
4. WHEN patterns emerge THEN machine learning models SHALL adapt and improve
5. WHEN incidents occur THEN detailed logs SHALL be available for investigation

### Requirement 7: API Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want to integrate Hlekkr's deepfake detection capabilities into my application, so that I can provide media verification services to my users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers access the API THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be available
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL be authenticated and rate-limited
3. WHEN integrations are built THEN webhook notifications SHALL be supported
4. WHEN bulk processing is needed THEN batch API endpoints SHALL be available
5. WHEN API versions change THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 8: Advanced Analysis and Reporting

**User Story:** As a research analyst, I want to generate detailed reports on deepfake trends and patterns, so that I can understand emerging threats and inform policy decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are requested THEN they SHALL include statistical analysis of detection patterns
2. WHEN data is analyzed THEN privacy-preserving techniques SHALL protect user information
3. WHEN trends are identified THEN visualizations SHALL be generated automatically
4. WHEN reports are exported THEN multiple formats SHALL be supported (PDF, CSV, JSON)
5. WHEN historical data is queried THEN efficient search and filtering SHALL be available

### Requirement 9: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure access controls that match my role and responsibilities, so that I can access appropriate features while maintaining system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN they SHALL be authenticated via Amazon Cognito
2. WHEN roles are assigned THEN permissions SHALL be enforced at API and UI levels
3. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN multi-factor authentication SHALL be required
4. WHEN access patterns are unusual THEN security alerts SHALL be generated
5. WHEN user sessions expire THEN automatic logout SHALL occur with data preservation

### Requirement 10: Scalable Infrastructure and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle varying loads efficiently, so that performance remains consistent regardless of usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load increases THEN Lambda functions SHALL auto-scale to meet demand
2. WHEN media files are large THEN processing SHALL be optimized for performance
3. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN response times SHALL remain under 2 seconds
4. WHEN storage grows THEN S3 lifecycle policies SHALL manage costs automatically
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN graceful degradation SHALL maintain core functionality

### Requirement 11: Comprehensive Security Scanning and Threat Detection

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all uploaded media files to be automatically scanned for viruses, malware, and malicious content, so that the platform remains secure and protected from threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media is uploaded THEN it SHALL be immediately scanned for viruses and malware before processing
2. WHEN malicious content is detected THEN the file SHALL be quarantined and blocked from further processing
3. WHEN scanning completes THEN security results SHALL be stored in the audit trail with threat classifications
4. WHEN threats are found THEN administrators SHALL be immediately notified via multiple channels
5. WHEN files are clean THEN they SHALL proceed to normal deepfake analysis workflow
6. WHEN scanning fails THEN files SHALL be quarantined pending manual review
7. WHEN embedded threats are detected THEN detailed threat intelligence SHALL be captured
8. WHEN suspicious patterns emerge THEN automated threat hunting SHALL be triggered
